**Case Study: Targeted Marketing for Low-Performing Serum Product (SK4382)**

**Objective:**  
Developed a CatBoostClassifier model to predict low-performing serum purchases (SK4382) based on customer behavior and weather conditions. The model classifies customers into two groups:  
- **1:** Customers likely to purchase SK4382 during low humidity (â‰¤ 50.9%).  
- **0:** Customers buying during high humidity.

The model achieved high performance with 99.89% accuracy, 99.88% F1 score, 99.76% precision, and 100% recall on 20,000 samples.

**Key Insights:**  
Integrated real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed) with historical purchase data. Found a **moderate negative correlation (-0.31)** between humidity and serum sales, indicating lower sales in higher humidity.

**Visualization & Analysis:**  
- **Revenue Trends:** Monthly comparison of SK4382 vs. all other product sales from 2024-2025 (bar graph + trend line).
- **Weather Impact:** Visualized temperature trends and a correlation heatmap between weather conditions and serum sales.
- **Complementary Products:** Analyzed sales of complementary items like **ANTIAGING** products bought alongside SK4382.

**Marketing Strategy:**  
Designed a targeted marketing model to identify high-probability serum buyers using demographics and weather data. Optimized ad placements based on peak purchasing periods and weather conditions, driving higher conversion rates in beauty-focused social media campaigns.

**Conclusion:**  
By combining weather data and customer behavior, this project optimized targeted marketing and provided actionable insights for improving sales and ad spend efficiency.
